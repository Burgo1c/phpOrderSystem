Configuring LHa for areas in Europe and elsewhere where single-byte
filenames are used


First, if there's no 'configure' script, you'll need to regenerate it.
This requires the GNU autoconf tools. Run them like this:

$ aclocal
$ autoheader
$ automake -a
$ autoconf

[or run the 'autoreconf -is' script.]

To check that all is well, say:

$ ./configure && make && make check

This chain should run to completion with no failures. The only problem is
that if you have files which have names with accented letters, LHa will
store them correctly but mangle them when listing or extracting.

The easiest way around this is to reconfigure LHa to ignore the existence of
multi-byte filenames:

$ ./configure --disable-multibyte-filename && make && make check

It should still pass all tests after this.

LHa will now never modify filenames, not even when you want it to.

All that's left now is to install the program. In this case, it will be
installed in /usr/local (if on a Unix/Linux computer) which is usually
owned by 'root' (the super-user).

$ su -c "make install"
